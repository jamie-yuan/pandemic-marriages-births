# Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Marriage and Birth Rates in Canada
A computational exploration on how COVID-19 has affected marriages and births, developed for the University of Toronto CSC110 Final Project.

## Introduction
With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic reaching most every aspect of life, major decisions like getting married and having children have not been left out. Factors such as the decreased ability to socialize face-to-face, lockdown orders, and financial insecurity due to circumstances like job layoffs, have all potentially impacted the rate that these significant decisions have been made. This project uses statistical and regression analysis with Canadian marriage and birth data to explore the following research question: In 2018-2020, how has the COVID-19 pandemic affected two of Canadiansâ€™ most important life decisions, getting married and having children? Specifically, how has the rate of these measures changed with the rate of COVID-19 cases?

## Usage
Install the Python libraries Pandas and Plotly, and download the COVID19 Data and Vital Events Data by Month datasets, as well as the four Python files. Open main.py, and run the main block. Within a few moments of running, two graphs displaying actual and computed-on data, as shown below, should pop up in a browser window. Toggle on and off individual labelled lines on the right-hand side to more easily see various trends. <img width="1440" alt="Graphs of COVID-19 Cases, Marriages, and Births" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96459423/147297689-3456746e-02a4-4a64-8f51-853e7c61168d.png">
